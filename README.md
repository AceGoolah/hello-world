# hello-world
My Intro project to github
AceGoolah learning how to code!! Always was fascinated by computers, electronics, gadgets, etc.  Never tried to learn about it, and figured why not start before I'm 6 feet deep one day.

I'm 27 married, goofy yet serious at the same time.  I'm a straight up Leo who loves to get down with some Lo-Fi/Chill Hop. I'm really glad to be here and hope I can get to know and work with some amazing people. 
That's it for now, I wanna get started and see where this stuff takes me.  
Peace and Love ya'll!
